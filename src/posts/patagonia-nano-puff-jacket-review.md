The Patagonia nano puff jacket is an expensive investment compared to other puffer jackets on the market, so is it worth the price tag?

Having owned the Patagonia Nano Puff jacket for more than six months and experiencing a range of climates when wearing it, here are my thoughts on if you should consider purchasing it.

## What is the Patagonia Nano Puff Jacket?

The Patagonia Nano Puff jacket is a windproof, water-resistant puffer jacket that has been specifically designed to be lightweight and highly compressible.

This jacket is an ideal might-weight layer for winter travelers that have limited packing space or who are layering up and down between seasons and continents.

The jacket will keep you warm in cold conditions and is a must-have for layering up but can be stored away in your bag during your summer trips just as easily.

There are two variations of the puffer jacket, one with a hood and one without. If you're planning to wear an outer shell like the [Patagonia 3L waterproof jacket](https://www.greensontour.com/posts/patagonia-black-torrent-shell-3l-jacket-review/) you might find your shell has a hood already - and it may be inconvenient to have two hoods tucked behind you.

### Pros

* Packable and compressible
* Super lightweight
* Keeps your warm

### Cons

* Expensive
* Zipper can be tricky

## Design: How does it look and feel?

The nano puff jacket has a minimalistic look and comes in a variety of colors.

It feels extremely lightweight and comfortable to wear.

It will also keep you surprisingly warm despite its lightness. This is due to the jacket's use of a "box-wall" construction for its pockets. This creates a bricklayer type pattern on the outer jacket much like most puffer jackets you'll see.

### How does the puff jacket keep you warm?

Each pocket is filled with insulation material which is how the jacket keeps you warm.

The heat from your body warms and radiates the heat inside the pockets, which is then trapped, creating a layer of warm air.

## Ease of use: How easy is it to pack away?

The Nano puff is super easy to pack away. There is an inside pocket that allows you to tuck the coat into and double-zip it to close it.

## Key features

### Super compressible

If you're a backpacker like me, weight and compressibility are everything when it comes to packing for your next adventure. The nano jacket is easily compressible into the inside pocket of the jacket and tucks away nicely into a bag without adding too much weight or space.

### Made from quality materials

The jacket is made from "60-g PrimaLoftÂ® Gold Insulation Eco" which is currently the leading brand in synthetic insulation.

PrimaLoft insulation mimics all the great properties of down, with the additional advantage of providing superior waterproof protection.

The coat also uses recyclable materials - 68% of Patagonia fabrics are made with recycled materials.

### Keeps you surprisingly warm

Despite being such a lightweight and thin jacket, the quality of the [PrimaLoft insulation](https://expertworldtravel.com/what-is-primaloft-insulation/) means that you'll stay warm in this jacket. Whether you're using this jacket for casual wear, hiking, and work you'll stay warm and dry in this.

## FAQ

### What temperature is Patagonia Nano Puff good for?

The coat performs well at temperatures between 30 to 50 degrees and works well as a mid-layer in winter.

### Is the Nano Puff good for winter?

Even on extremely cold days, the Nano Puff provides good levels of warmth - we suggest pairing this with other layers as it works well as both a coat and mid-layer depending on how cold it is.

### Can you wear a Patagonia Nano Puff in the rain?

Yes, unlike down jackets which are more prone to absorb moisture the nano puffer uses a synthetic water-resistant type material to protect you from the rain. You can also wear a raincoat over the top of the puff for added protection.

## Should you buy the Patagonia Nano Puff?

The Patagonia Nano Puff is certainly worth the investment if you're looking for a premium light-weight compressible puffer jacket. Patagonia also offers free repairs if you damage the jacket so it is considered a long-term investment.
