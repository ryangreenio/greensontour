Should you buy the Patagonia Black Torrent Shell 3L? After 6 months of use during the summer and winter seasons, here are our thoughts on if you should buy this outer shell waterproof jacket.

## What is the Patagonia Torrent Shell 3L Jacket?

The Patagonia Torrent Shell 3L Jacket is a high-quality raincoat that performs well in torrential rain.

It's lightweight, packable, breathable and most importantly keeps you dry during heavy rainfall (up to 3L). The jacket works well as an outer shell and it's spacious enough to fit thermals, a hoodie, and a puffer jacket underneath quite comfortably.

During the summer months, you can wear this over a t-shirt when it rains without overheating due to its lightweight materials.

Paired with the Patagonia nano puff jacket, these two travel jackets make the perfect combination when travelling across different climates. Both jackets pack away easily and provide the right level of warmth/coolness - whatever weather conditions you find yourself in.


## Pros

- Packable
- High-quality materials
- Waterproof and breathable performance
- Comfortable to wear

## Cons

- Expensive
- Fits a little big (had to go down a size)

## Key Features

Not all rain jackets are created equal and the Patagonia torrent shell is definitely a top-of-the-line raincoat compared to most standard jackets.

One of my favorite features of this coat (and there are several) is that it packs away into its own pocket making it easy to store away when it's not in use. This is handy for those who are backpacking; where you only have limited space.

Another feature that makes this coat unique is its triple-layer fabric - the top layer is highly water-repellent with a breathable membrane and comes with a lightweight jersey lining.

The jacket is windproof and breathable and the sleeve cuffs and the waistband are also adjustable so you can ensure extra protection from wind and rain.

Plenty of pockets, as well as 2 breathable arm pit zips to stop you from overheating.

## Can I travel the world with it?

Yes! In hotter climates, this jacket works well to protect you from rain showers without overheating. During winter months you can wear this over all your thermal layers as an outer shell (we also recommend wearing it with a puffer jacket as the raincoat is not designed to keep you warm) to stay toasty and dry.

## Is it worth the price tag?

Patagonia is a globally recognized brand that has made the news recently after its founder donated the billion-dollar company to charity to tackle climate change. Its commitment to climate and sustainable products is a worthy reason to consider any Patagonia purchase.

One of the unique selling points of this coat is that it provides a lot more rain protection than standard rackets and it's packable. You'll probably be able to find a cheaper coat but not for the same quality [Patagonia](https://eu.patagonia.com/gb/en/home/) offers.

## Fit & Sizing

You should proceed with caution around the fit and sizing of this jacket. As someone who typically wears a medium, the jacket had a slightly larger fit and the sleeves were a little long. Of course, being a larger jacket allows you to layer up but means it may be slightly baggy looking if you wear it without layers.

Going for a size smaller, still allows you to fit all your additional layers underneath but it also didn't look too big when wearing it with just a t-shirt in the summer.

## Performance in the Field

The raincoat does what it says on the tin. It was fully waterproof during torrential rain and kept me dry even during windy and harsh conditions.

### Can you use Patagonia Torrentshell for skiing?

The Patagonia Torrentshell 3L is a good choice for skiing although we recommend trying the jacket on with the layers you intend to wear.

### What does Patagonia 3L mean?

3L stands for three layers referring to the membrane of the jacket being laminated between the face fabric and a protective knit backing rather than the top.

### Is the Patagonia Torrentshell 3L jacket waterproof?

Yes! The Patagonia Torrentshell 3L jacket waterproof is an excellent choice for keeping you dry in harsh rainfall conditions. It is one of the top-rated rain jackets based on its quality build and waterproofing at an excellent price.

### Should I size up in Patagonia?

This depends on the number of layers you intend to wear underneath. We recommend trying the jacket on with the layers you intend to wear.

# Should you buy it?

Our Verdict: 8/10: Yes, we'd recommend purchasing the [Patagonia Torrentshell 3L](https://eu.patagonia.com/gb/en/product/mens-torrentshell-3l-rain-jacket/85240.html)
