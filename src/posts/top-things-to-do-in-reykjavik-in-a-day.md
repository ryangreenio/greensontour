# Top Things To Do In Reykjavik In A Day

Reykjavik is the capital city of Iceland, a beautiful country located between Greenland and Norway, and slightly North East of the UK.

With a total of 376,000 people living in Iceland, Reykjavik makes up half of the Icelandic population (135,688).

With only a few hours to explore this vibrant city, we managed to narrow down some of the top things we wanted to do.

## 1. Laugavegur

It took us a bit of time to realize we were already here as this is a popular street in Reykjavik. It hosts some of the best shops, restaurants, and bars.

The street is filled with activities on the roads, a unique seating area, and just an all-round good vibe.

## 2. Hallgrimskirkja

This incredible church is a Lutheran parish church (Church of Iceland) and was completed in 1986. It is an incredible architectural design and not one to miss - you probably won't since its245 feet tall. You can see it from most points of the city (in case you get lost).

Hallgrimskirkja is the most visited place by tourists in Iceland each year, with thousands of people visiting every day.

## 3. Rainbow Street (Skólavörðustígur)

If you're anything like me and you love a bit of street color, the rainbow street will not disappoint! I can't think of anything better than a colorful street, especially one that shows support for the local LGBTQ community. There is also a fantastic crepe place right next to the rainbow which offers gluten-free and vegan crepes.

Skólavörðustígur honors Reykjavik Pride which has been celebrated annually since 1999. It represents inclusivity and diversity and has become a permanent part of downtown Reykjavik.

## 4. Tjörnin

Tjörnin is a small but prominent lake that is situated in the capital. It is surrounded by lots of cultural sites such as the [Gallery of Iceland](https://www.listasafn.is/en/) and [City Hall](https://visitreykjavik.is/city-hall).

One corner of the lake is geothermically heated, which means even in the freezing winters it will never freeze over. It's a perfect scenic walk to go on, just be sure to grab yourself a hot chocolate too!

## 5. FlyOver Iceland

A relatively new addition to Reykjavik is [FlyOver Iceland](https://www.flyovericeland.com/).

FlyOver Iceland is a virtual reality ride where the seat moves side to side in front of a large screen giving you the impression of flying. You see some amazing views of Iceland all year round.

You'll learn about the history, meet some trolls and fly across the country.

## 6. Sun Voyager

The Sun Voyager is a fantastic sculpture right next to the Icelandic sea.

We ended up going for a night-time stroll on our walk home from The Old Icelandic Restaurant where we were amazed at the design. It was built by Jón Gunnar Árnason in 1990 and should be on your list to check out!

## 7. Harpan

The [Harpan](https://harpa.is/en/) is a concert hall and conference center built out of colored glass. It looked beautiful during the day and at night time it lit up the surrounding area. We recommend checking out a show if you have time.

## 8. Sky Lagoon

Perhaps our top thing to do in Iceland was the Sky Lagoon. A geothermal pool is situated on the edge of the sea. With spectacular views and a swim-up bar we highly recommend a visit.

## 9. Icelandic restaurant

A trip to Reykjavik would not be complete without trying some local cuisine. Typically this consists of fish, lamb, or Icelandic skyr (a type of yogurt). Our favorite restaurant was The Old Icelandic Restaurant but there are many great options to choose from.

## 10. Perlan

The [Perlan](https://www.perlan.is/en-gb) offers an incredible 360 view of Iceland where you can enjoy lunch with a view. We also paid for tickets which give you access to the world's first indoor ice cave and Iceland's only planetarium where you can learn more about the northern lights.

## Is Reykjavik worth visiting?

Yes, we think Reykjavik is an unmissable city when visiting Iceland and we highly recommend a trip. You'll be able to pack most of this list in one day but we recommend two full days to experience it fully.
