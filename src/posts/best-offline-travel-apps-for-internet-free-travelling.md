It can be easy to take for granted not having the internet in your pocket when you're traveling overseas. When traveling it's not always possible to have access to the internet availability that we're used to.

We often arrive in a new country and the first thing we want to do is book a taxi, tell someone we're safe, or open up a map and figure out how to get from A to Z.

When you realize your roaming is off and accessibility to the internet is limited it can be tricky.

There are a few options of course:

* You buy a new sim
* Prepare for some expensive roaming charges
* Try to connect to free wifi hotspots
* Use offline travel apps

When it comes to offline travel apps, we've been narrowing down our must-have apps that work offline and without the internet for traveling. Here are our top picks:

## 1. Google Maps

Without a doubt make sure you have [Google maps](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-maps/id585027354) and download an offline map. There is nothing worse than being lost, needing a map, and not having internet. This does take a bit of pre-planning, but trust us it is worth it.

## 2. Tripcoin

If you're traveling between countries with different currencies it can sometimes get confusing. If you've ever asked yourself "How much did we just pay for coffee?" you're not alone.

The euro, pound, and dollar are relatively similar, but some currencies like Icelandic Króna are very different. Currently, £1 is equal to 162.72 Krona?!?!

To keep track of what we were spending we used [Tripcoin](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tripcoin-travel-budget/id896518806). It works offline and converts any currency to another.

## 3. Google Translate

[Google Translate](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/google-translate/id414706506) works offline providing you download your language of choice beforehand to translate. You can also point the camera at a menu or sign to translate in real time. There are more features when using an internet connection but the basics work well without wifi.

## 4. WiFi Map

Sometimes you just need to find a place with Wifi. [WiFi Map](https://www.wifimap.io/) is a useful app to help you find WiFi in the location you're in. The paid version of the app allows you to download the map offline so you can find free wifi spots near you easily.

## 5. Apple Wallet

[Apple wallet](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204003) is handy for those of you who own iPhones since you can save your tickets and documents to your wallet for offline access. Whether you're scanning your boarding pass or showing entry tickets to an event or museum, an offline wallet can come in handy!

## 6. TripAdvisor

An offline version of [TripAdvisor](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/tripadvisor-plan-book-trips/id284876795) allows you to do much of the same research you can do online. You can download reviews, maps, and your saved locations for over 300 popular cities around the world.

## 7. Spotify

We highly recommend music streaming services like [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/download/other/) which allow you to download thousands of songs offline and listen to music on the go without the internet. Whether you're in the sky listening to songs, passing time by during a layover, or exploring a new city - offline music can be essential.

## 8. Netflix

Being entertained on long journeys can be challenging without the internet. Movie streaming services like [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/app) offer offline-download features which give you up to 30 days to watch your selected downloads.
